## Summary of the Community's Needs

Provide a summary of what you learned from your community assessment, coupled with the feedback from others (like the opinion of other Campus Experts, community leaders, and stakeholders).

The following pieces might help strengthen this section:
- **Community demographics**: The community is made up of close to 50 students (Hoping to increase with more freshmen this year) with about 25 consistent and active members and 5 leads. Most of the members are beginners in HTML/CSS, Java and Android who have started 
their majors in Computer science but the community is opened to all students interested in the entrepreneurship side of coding. The leaders are experienced HTML/CSS, Java and Android developers who are equally passionate about entrepreneurship. Equally, experienced staff members are available as facilitators. We equally have a shared folder on google drive containing some resources.
- **Communication**: Invites to events/meetups are usually sent via email to all on our mailing list while reminders are posted our our Facebook page. We equally use posters to spread the word about upcoming events.
- **Culture**: Our community is opened to any new member from any major who shows interest and commitment and also to new ideas which must be validated by the leaders. No document clearly stating our policies and procedures but in case of conflict, the community leaders are required to discuss and agree on a possible solution. We equally engage our members to always hear their opinion in order to act for a common good.


## Your Proposal

In this section, articulate the project you want to accomplish during the Campus Experts program; provide a brief summary of what you are planning to accomplish with your project.

The following pieces might help strengthen this section:
- **Timing**: This proposal is to be executed as from January 2017 when school resumes.
- **Community demographics**: We plan on informing other students in neigboring Universities and also to get interested  freshmen involved in our activities through posters, announcements during other events on campus and facebook. This will help create a diverse community of students from different universities, majors, sexes but with a common interest.
- **Goals**: The general aim is to build a community of developers, innovators, creatives and changemakers who can used their coding skills to implement entrepreneurial ideas. The first goal will be to introduce the community to GitHub.
- **Communication**: We hope to continue meeting twice monthly with event invites being sent out by email and added on google calendar. Also, meetups/hackathons or  codesprings will be posted on the community's facebook page and posters created depending on the event.


## Your Proposal's Impact

In this section, analyze your community's needs against what your proposal aims to accomplish.
Itemize each of the needs you hope to address with your proposal and indicate whether each of these needs are within the scope of your proposal.

When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:
- Target audience
  - Beginners in Computer Science at the African Leadership University.
- Community needs
  - Helping students develop coding skills in HTML/CSS, Java, Android and using GitHub.
- Resources
  - Many more mentors and experienced facilitators will be invited during our events. 
  - I will download the necessary tools before the events.
  - I will get a projector from school.
- Media
  - I plan on delivering this community impact proposal during a workshop on campus.
  - The date of the workshop will be announced during an event called "The Assembly" which brings together all staffs and students.
  - To deliver the content, I intend on preparing some slides on the basics, getting the necessary tools ready.
- Content knowledge
  - I have been using GitHub and I intend to enhance my knowledge using video tutorials and mentors.
- Timeline
  - Develop a rough timeline for your community impact project.
  - I wil do my research work on GitHub and how important it is for developers.
  - Then prepare a powerpoint presentation that will last 30mins.
  - After the presentation, we will have 1 hour to help each community member create their GitHub accounts and familiarize themselves.

## Planning for the Future

In this section, think about how your efforts can expand beyond this 8-week program. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:

- When will you review the impact of your proposal? After each event/meetup, I will review the impact of my proposal.
- How will you measure success? The success of my proposal will be measured by the increase in the number and quality of projects students will be working on showing increase in skills.
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans? After reviewing the success of an event, the results will indicate if to iterate or not.
